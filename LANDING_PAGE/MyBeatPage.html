	to quit love. However, despite all the tears, the quartet is still longing for romance.<br><br>
	Blackpink's Jennie and Jisoo co-wrote the lyrics along with LØREN (Lee Seungjoo),

	<br>
	<p><b>"Fancy"</b> is an adorable and groovy song about a girl’s desire for a guy. The music video is a cute combination 
	of interesting visuals coupled with cute dance moves. The music is audibly pleasing and speaks to every teen girl 
	out there. The words are easy to follow and drive home the core message. Symbolism is used extensively throughout 
	the piece. Shots of roses, planets, and chocolates allude to the sweetness and pain of falling in love. One thing 
	to note is that the video is quite colorful. This jibes well with the vibrant and youthful vibe that TWICE are 
	aiming for.</p>

	<p>Red Velvet (레드벨벳) is a girl group that consists of 5 members: Irene, Wendy, Seulgi,

	<br>
	<p>Single from Red Velvet’s EP entitled “The ReVe Festival: Finale”. That particular album is 
	the third in a trio of The ReVe Festival EPs that the group has dropped in 2019, with the series 
	proving to be internationally-successful.</p>
	<p>The song <b>“Psycho”</b> wants to give the idea of the singer being mentally disturbed. 
	And what is causing this disturbance is certain aspects of the romantic relationship she is in.<br><br> 
	For instance, people think that she and her partner make a “weird” couple. And even she is able 
	to admit that it is in fact a “strange relationship”. And what is particularly awkward about it 
	is the couple’s tendency to fight but then shortly thereafter make love, not war.</p>

	it showcases the musical talents of each member and how well they gel with each other. The premise of the song 
	is about a girl loving that one guy and how she is not shy to say it. She has an assertive personality and is 
	unafraid to speak her mind. 
	<br><br>
	The music is hip and the lyrics add a great deal of sass to the overall composition.

	<h2>Ludwig van Beethoven</h2>

	<img src="MARIÑAS_MEDIA_ITAD/ludwig.jpg" alt="L.V Beethoven Image" title="Ludwig Beethoven" class="left1"/>
	<p style="color:white">Ludwig van Beethoven was a German pianist and composer widely considered to be one of the greatest 
	musical geniuses of all time. His innovative compositions combined vocals and instruments, widening 
	the scope of sonata, symphony, concerto and quartet. He is the crucial transitional figure connecting 
	the Classical and Romantic ages of Western music. </p>
	<br>
	<p style="color:white">This is the popular name of one of Ludwig van Beethoven's most popular compositions "Bagatelle in A Minor." 
	Anyone who's come across a child practicing piano has most likely heard this.<br><br>
	<b>"Für Elise"</b> wasn't written for Elise at all. Beethoven's autographed manuscript reads: "Fur Therese am 27 
	zur Erinnerung and L v Bthvn" ("For Therese on the 27th April in remembrance of L. V Bthvn."), the Therese being 
	Therese Malfatti (1792–1851), with whom Beethoven was in love. However the copyist misread Beethoven's untidy scrawl 
	and gave his new piano piece the dedication "Für Elise."</p>

	<p style="color:white">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a musician capable of playing multiple instruments 
	who started playing in public at the age of 6. Over the years, Mozart aligned himself with a variety of 
	European venues and patrons, composing hundreds of works that included sonatas, symphonies, masses, chamber music, 
	concertos and operas, marked by vivid emotion and sophisticated textures</p>
	<br>
	<p style="color:white"><b>"The Marriage of Figaro"</b> is a comic opera by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, with an Italian libretto 
	by Lorenzo Da Ponte, based on Pierre Beaumarchais' 1778 stage comedy, Le Mariage de Figaro. Beaumarchais' play was at 
	first banned in Mozart's home city of Vienna because its anti-aristocratic overtones were considered dangerous in the 
	decade before the French revolution. Da Ponte's libretto omitted the original's political references and the opera became 
	one of Mozart's most successful works and the overture is especially famous and is often played as a concert piece.</p>

	<h2>Johann Sebastian Bach</h2>
	<img src="MARIÑAS_MEDIA_ITAD/bach.jpg" alt="J.S Bach Image" title="Bach" class="left1"/>
	<p style="color:white">Johann Sebastian Bach had a prestigious musical lineage and took on various organist positions during 
	the early 18th century, creating famous compositions like "Toccata and Fugue in D minor." Some of his best-known compositions 
	are the "Mass in B Minor," the "Brandenburg Concertos" and "The Well-Tempered Clavier." Bach died in Leipzig, Germany, on July 
	28, 1750. Today, he is considered one of the greatest Western composers of all time.</p>
	<br>
	<p style="color:white">This is a piece of organ music believed to be composed by Bach sometime in the middle of the first 
	decade of the 18th century. It is one of the most famous works in the organ repertoire.The attribution of the piece to Bach 
	has been challenged since the 1980s by a number of scholars for stylistic reasons. However as no definite name has cropped 
	up as the piece's composer, it is still usually listed under Bach's name.It is believed that this piece was almost certainly 
	not conceived for the organ and was probably originally written for the violin.</p>

	<p>The group released this on an independent album (also called <b>MMMBop</b>) in 1996. It helped get 
	them a record deal and was released as their first single in 1997, when Isaac Hanson was 16 years old, Taylor was 13,

	<h2>Billy Joel</h2>
	<img src="MARIÑAS_MEDIA_ITAD/bj.jpg" alt="Billy Joel Image" title="Billy Joel" class="left1"/>
	<p style="color:white">Billy Joel gets a lot of song ideas in his dreams, and often struggles to remember them when he wakes up. 
	For this song, however, he woke up with the song in his head, but tried NOT to write it. He explained on The 
	Howard Stern Show in 2010: "I thought, Who the hell am I to try to pull off this gospel song, so I took a shower 
	to wash this song away. I sang it in the shower and knew I had to do it."
	<br><br>
	In Joel's dream, he was "walking in his sleep," which inspired that lyric.</p>
	<br>
	<p style="color:white">Joel has said that the phrase <b>"River of Dreams"</b> is a play on the phrase "Stream of Consciousness."
	A very spiritual song where Joel, who identifies himself as an atheist, includes some biblical imagery, including 
	the line, "Through the valley of fear," which is a reference to Psalm 23:4 - "Though I walk through the valley of 
	the shadow of death, I will fear no evil." Joel also says that the river is a religious image, as "there's baptizing 
	in a river and you have to cross the river - people are getting dunked in the river and there's rivers of blood."	</p>

	meaning "long live life" or more literally, "the life lives" - after he saw the phrase on a painting by Mexican 
	artist Frida Kahlo. He explained: "She went through a lot of s--t, of course, and then she started a big painting 
	in her house that said 'Viva la Vida.' I just loved the boldness of it."</p>
