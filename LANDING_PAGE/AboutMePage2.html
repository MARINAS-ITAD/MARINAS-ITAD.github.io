		Happy to say that almost all of us in STE are with honors, highest honor, valedictorian.<sup>24</sup> My teenage and junior high was really memorable.<sup>25</sup> 
		After completion, me and friends especially my squad are going to enroll in different schools for senior high.<sup>26</sup> 
		Me and my 4 STE classmates enrolled in La Salle College Antipolo and took STEM strand.<sup>27</sup> It’s really quiet there 
		because it’s away from the town, or center.<sup>28</sup> Everything goes well and together graduated high school in 2019.<sup>29</sup>

		After graduating high school I was like, I need a break,can I stop for a while like I will not enroll college.<sup>1</sup> 
		I can’t decide what course I should take.<sup>2</sup> I dreamed of surgeon, because of the movies, k-dramas I watched about doctors.<sup>3</sup> 
		I dreamed of architecture, because somehow I want to design a house and know about drawing and designing.<sup>4</sup> College of music in UPD or 
		UST but it didn’t happened.<sup>5</sup> I didn’t have to chance to choose and try all of that because of insecurity and 
		because I’m scared too.<sup>6</sup> Hearing the word college was like hell for us I don’t know why.<sup>7</sup> I dream 
		to study in Manila that’s why I looked for universities in Manila.<sup>8</sup> My friend in Philippine Youth Symphonic 
		Band invited me to try in UE Manila and try to be scholar of band there.<sup>9</sup> I didn’t have a chance to reject 
		her invite because my parents know that she invited me.<sup>10</sup> So I try, because my parents also wanted already 
		to enroll myself.<sup>11</sup> 
		<br>
		<p><img src="MARIÑAS_MEDIA_ITAD/c3.jpg" alt="Selfie with eye glasses and face mask on the chin" title="First Year, First Semester" class="right1"/>
		I audition first before taking an entrance exam.<sup>12</sup> When I found out that I passed 
		the audition, my parents are happy because they can finally save and focus spending or investing their saving to my younger 
		sister.<sup>13</sup> At first, I want to try to take BSND, I don’t know why.<sup>14</sup> I told my parents I will take BSND, 
		but my father said something so it’s a no.<sup>15</sup> Days have passed, they are annoyed and started to scold me because 
		I’m still not enroll and no decision at all.<sup>16</sup> So I don’t know why I ended up taking BSIT, because I guess I heard 
		that there’s few math subjects I think.<sup>17</sup> I really don’t know, then little by little I learned and accept the fact 
		that it’s really true that I ended up and took BSIT.<sup>18</sup> I’m from Antipolo and every day I commute to go school.<sup>19</sup> 
		<br>
		<br>
		At first it was really hard for me to adapt and I’m glad that I met some people and we became friends or squad.<sup>20</sup> 
		As the time and year level passed by, our bond is getting stronger and stronger, <big><s>even though sometimes we’re pulling 
		each other to be lazy</s></big> or just chill but we’re still moving forward to learn and <mark>graduate together on time.</mark><sup>21</sup>
